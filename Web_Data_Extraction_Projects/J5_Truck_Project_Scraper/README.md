# Scraping Texas DMV - Beautiful Soup 4

<p>
This project involved scraping the Texas DMV for information about trucks on the website.  
<br />
URL redirection was an added complexity in this project so sending cookies and mimicking a referrer URL to get the results page added an aspect of complexity to this project.
<br />
Project used <b>Beautiful Soup 4 and requests modules</b> and stored the results in a <b>json file</b>.  
<br />
<b>
The following details scraped were from multiple URLs:</b>
<br />
<br />
1. Certificate Information about the trucks
<br />
2. Insurance information
<br />
3. Owner Information
<br />
4. Vehicle History
<br />
5. Other vehicles the owner uses
<br />
